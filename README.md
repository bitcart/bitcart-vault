# BitcartCC Vault

This project acts as a bridge between hardware devices and BitcartCC APIs. You launch it on your local PC, connect your hardware device and allow access to it, BitcartCC does the rest.

Currently it is packaged and should work on:

- Windows 10
- Ubuntu 18.04+ or similar
- Mac OS 10.15+
